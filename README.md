# fennel-fp-neovim

A series of Neovim Plugin Development introduction articles, using Fennel as the programming language to explain Lisp, FP, and advanced programming ideas.

## Exploring Fennel and Functional Programming in Neovim

In the AI era, developers need to think about new development paradigms: "AI helps us quickly generate code, but debugging and verification still require active developer intervention." This series of articles will start with Neovim + Fennel, guiding readers into the new world of "Interactive Development" and "Functional Programming".

Content includes:

* Fennel Language: Syntax, commonly used libraries.
* Lisp Thinking: S-expression editing, interactive development.
* Functional Programming: Pure functions, practical techniques like map/filter/reduce.
* Neovim Plugin Development: From simple scripts to complete plugins.
* Patterns and Principles: The rules that guide us to success.

Let's explore smarter and more elegant ways of program development together in the AI era.
